	<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">My</span> Booksellers inform&#8217;d me, lately, that
    several inquiries had been made for <cite>My Night-Gown
    and Slippers</cite>,&#8212;but that every copy had
    been sold;&#8212;they had been out of print these
    two years.&#8212;&#8220;Then publish them again,&#8221; said
    I, boldly,&#8212;(I print at my own risk)&#8212;and with
    an air of triumph. Messrs. Cadell and Davies
    advise&#8217;d me to make additions.&#8212;&#8220;The <cite>Work</cite>
    is, really, too short,&#8221; said Messrs. Cadell and
    Davies,&#8212;&#8220;I wish, gentlemen,&#8221; return&#8217;d I, &#8220;my
    readers were of your opinion.&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;I protest,
    <a class="pagenum" id="pagevi" title="vi">&nbsp;</a>Sir,&#8221; said they, (and they asserted it, both
    together, with great emphasis,) &#8220;you have but
    <em>Three Tales</em>.&#8221;&#8212;I told them, carelessly, it was
    enough for the greatest <em>Bashaw</em>, among modern
    poets, and wish&#8217;d them a good morning. When
    a man, as Sterne observes, &#8220;can extricate himself
    with an <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">equivoque</em>, in such an unequal
    match,&#8221;&#8212;(and two booksellers to one poet are
    tremendous odds)&#8212;&#8220;he is not ill off;&#8221;&#8212;but
    reflecting a little, as I went home, I began to
    think my pun was a vile one,&#8212;and did not
    assist me, one jot, in my argument;&#8212;and, now
    I have put it upon paper, it appears viler still;&#8212;it
    is execrable.&#8212;So, without much further
    reasoning, I sat down to rhyming;&#8212;rhyming, as
    the reader will see, in open defiance of <em>all
    reason</em>,&#8212;except the reasons of Messrs. Cadell and
    Davies.&#8212;</p>


	<p><a class="pagenum" id="pagevii" title="vii">&nbsp;</a>Thus you have <cite>My Night-Gown and Slippers</cite>,
    with <em>Additions</em>, converted to <cite>Broad Grins</cite>;&#8212;and
    &#8217;tis well if they may not end in <em>Wide Yawns</em> at
    last! Should this be the case, gentle Reviewers,
    do not, ungratefully, attempt to break my sleep,
    (<em>you will find it labour lost</em>) because I have contributed
    to your&#8217;s.</p>

				<p>They talk&#8217;d of such, and such, and such a man;</p>
				<p class="i2">Of those who could, and those who could not write.</p>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3">&nbsp;</a>It cost them very little pains</p>

				<p>His valour, like a murrain among cattle,</p>
				<p class="i2">Was reckon&#8217;d very fatal in the field.</p>
				<p>Yet, tho&#8217; Sir Thomas had an iron fist,</p>
				<p>He was, at heart, a mild Philanthropist.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>Much did he grieve, when making Frenchmen die,</p>
				<p class="i2">To any inconvenience to put &#8217;em:</p>
				<p>&#8220;It quite distress&#8217;d his feelings,&#8221; he would cry,</p>

			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p class="i2">Thus, during many a Campaign,</p>

				<p><a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>Lamenting sorely for men&#8217;s souls,</p>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>Till palling on his Laurels, grown so thick,</p>
				<p>(As boys pull blackberries, till they are sick,)</p>
				<p class="i6">Homeward he bent his course, to wreath &#8217;em;</p>
				<p>And in his Castle, near fair Norwich town,</p>
				<p>Glutted with glory, he sat down,</p>
				<p class="i6">In perfect solitude, beneath &#8217;em.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>Now, sitting under Laurels, Heroes say,</p>

			<p>An old Gentlewoman, a great admirer of the <strong class="fancy">black letter</strong>, (as
				many <em>old Gentlewomen</em> are) presented the Author of these
				Tales with the <em>Original MS.</em> of this Sonnet; advising the
				publication of a <em>facsimile</em> of the Knight&#8217;s hand-writing. It
				is painful, after this, to advance, that the Sonnet, so far
				from being genuine, is <em>one</em> of the clumsiest literary
				forgeries, that the present times have witnessed. It appears,
				in this authentick Story, that Sir Thomas Erpingham was
				married in the reign of Henry the Fifth; and it is evidently
				intended, that <em>Moderns</em> should believe he writ these
				love-verses almost immediately after his marriage; not only
				from the ardour with which he celebrates the beauty of his
				wife, but from the circumstance of a man writing any
				love-verses upon his wife at all;&#8212;but the style and language
				of the lines are most glaringly inconsistent with their
				pretended date. The fact is, we have here foisted upon us a
				close <em>imitation of</em> <strong class="special_name">Cowley</strong>, (<em>vide the</em> <strong class="special_name">Mistress</strong>) who was not
				<em>born</em> till the year 1618,&#8212;two centuries after the era in
				question. Chaucer died, A. D. 1400; and Henry the Fifth (who
				was king only 9 years, 5 months, and 11 days) began his reign
				scarcely 13 years after the death of that Poet. Sir Thomas,
				then, must, at least, have written in the obsolete phraseology
				of Chaucer,&#8212;and, probably, would have imitated him,&#8212;as did
				Lidgate, Occleve, and others;&#8212;nay, Harding, Skelton, &amp;c. who
				were fifty or sixty years subsequent to Chaucer, were not so
				modern in their language as their celebrated predecessor.
				Having, <em>in few words</em>, prove&#8217;d (it is presume&#8217;d) this Sonnet
				to be spurious, an apology may be thought necessary for not
				saying <em>a great deal more</em>;&#8212;but this Herculean task is left,
				in deference, to the disputants on <em>Vortigern</em>; who will,
				doubtless, engage in it, as a matter of great importance, and,
				once more, lay the world under <em>very heavy</em> obligations, with
				various <em>Pamphlets in folio</em>, upon the subject:&#8212;and, surely,
				too many acknowledgments cannot be given to men who are so
				indefatigably generous in their researches, that half the
				result of them, when publish&#8217;d, causes even the sympathetick
				reader to labour as much as the Writer!</p>
